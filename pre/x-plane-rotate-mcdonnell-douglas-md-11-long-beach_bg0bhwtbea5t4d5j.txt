and not one, but more. The Mega Dog is one of them, but others are Mad =
Dog (not confusing with the MD-80 Series Maddog), Mechanical Disaster =
11, More Death 11, MD-911 and so on. Not really good names while the =
real MD-11 wasn=E2=80=99t that bad and the modeled Rotate MD-11 is =
actually a beauty.

> On May 26, 2017, Rotate posted news about the project that would be =
the follow up to their MD-80 model. The MD-11 has completed the long =
journey to release and is now available for X-Plane 11 in a cargo =
version with nine liveries and a white livery for livery painters. This =
is a complex aircraft with many features and systems that necessitates a =
long review.
>=20
> Because of this, X-Plained.com is dedicating two of its reviewers, =
Angelique van Campen and Paul Beckwith, to fully cover all aspects of =
the Rotate McDonnell Douglas MD-11. Angelique is your Pilot in Command =
and will be covering all aspects of the MD-11=E2=80=99s flight =
characteristics from starting up to shutting down. Paul will be your =
ground crew manager taking you on a tour of the physical model of the =
aircraft.

> In an effort to =E2=80=9Cmaintain transparency=E2=80=9D, Paul, your =
guide for the external and internals of the MD-11F, is but a humble =
turboprop bush pilot. This is my first exposure to the widebody world of =
flying which is why this intrepid reviewer will not subject you, the =
reader, to his newbie exploits of attempting to fly the MD-11F. (Suffice =
it to say, they haven=E2=80=99t been pretty.)
>=20
> While flying these things is not my strong suit, I have been flying GA =
for many years and have flown over many different scenery packages. I =
have also developed a few of my own WED airports and have painted more =
than a few liveries. Thus, in terms of modelling, PBR, and textures, I =
have a very good idea of what I=E2=80=99m looking for and although I am =
not a 3D artist by any stretch of the imagination.
>=20
> Introduction
>=20
> The MD-11 Takes Flight
> The McDonnell Douglas MD-11 program launched in 1986 and the aircraft =
flew for the first time out of Long Beach, California on 10 January =
1990. On 21 October of that year, it completed a four-leg, around the =
world, final test flight and set two point-to-point speed records while =
doing do. (1992 Delta Airlines MD-11 passenger brochure).
>=20
>  =
<https://www.x-plained.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Rotate_MD11_review_0=
2.jpg>
> The aircraft was FAA certified on 8 November 1990 and on 17 October =
1991 it was certified by the JAA. Finnair took delivery of the first =
MD-11 on 7 December 1990 and complete the first revenue producing flight =
on 20 December 1990. Delta Airlines completed the inaugural U.S. flight =
on 5 February 1991.
>=20
> The Delta Flight Museum (deltamuseum.org) notes the following as =
technical advances incorporated into the MD-11:
>=20
> Engines designed to provide maximum efficiency in their thrust class =
with fuel burn reductions compared to other engines on wide-body, =
tri-engine jets in 1991.
> Aerodynamic enhancements included winglets, a new tail cone, =
streamlined pylon-engine joints and a smaller horizontal stabilizer =
containing fuel tanks that could be used to trim the aircraft.
> More cargo capability than any other aircraft in 1991.
> Advanced flight deck allowed 2-pilot operations compared to the 3 =
crewmembers required for earlier tri-jets.
> More interior space per passenger and more carry-on baggage capacity =
than any other wide-body aircraft in 1991.
> A Medium-to long-range Widebody
> There was a time when two-engine jets were not certified for flights =
across the ocean. That mission required a four-engine jet because of the =
Federal Aviation Administration=E2=80=99s (FAA) =E2=80=9C60 minute =
rule=E2=80=9D predecessor to =E2=80=9CExtended-range Twin-engine =
Operational Performance Standards=E2=80=9D (ETOPS). The rule required =
all twin-jet aircraft to fly routes where the nearest airport would be =
no further than sixty-minutes away. The International Civil Aviation =
Organization (ICAO) recommended ninety-minutes for diversion time. Many =
regulatory authorities outside of the US adopted the ICAO =
recommendation.
>=20
> The sixty-minute regulation was waived for three-engine jets by the =
FAA in 1964 and that aircraft format became very popular. The =
three-engine jet was favored by the airlines because of its higher =
range, increased maximum payload, and increased capacity accomplished =
with a substantial fuel savings over the four-engine jet.

> The Hawker Siddeley HS-121 Trident and the Boeing 727 were two of the =
first tri-engine jets in production and it seems that their performance =
(mostly the 727) had some influence on the retraction of the =
sixty-minute rule for tri-jets. With that retraction, larger tri-jets =
came onto the market. The MD-11 is one of them.
>=20
> McDonnell Douglas conceived of the MD-11 as a derivative of the DC-10 =
and planned on developing it as a stretched version of that aircraft. =
The project was renamed to the MD-11 in 1984 when accidents began to =
erode the DC-10=E2=80=99s reputation. This new aircraft needed to be an =
improvement over the DC-10 and McDonnell Douglas focused on publicizing =
the new features.
>=20
> The most notable improvements were the publicized range and the =
introduction of a two-person glass cockpit that eliminated the need for =
a flight engineer. The MD-11 was also fitted with winglets following the =
results of joint research with NASA. The maximum take-off weight (MTOW) =
had a fourteen percent increase over the DC-10 and the fuselage was =
eleven percent longer. The vertical stabilizer above the third engine =
was smaller and the GE CF6-80-C2D1F engine was a major improvement over =
the DC-10=E2=80=99s engines. One-hundred-nineteen out of two-hundred =
aircraft were equipped with the GE engine which is the engine utilized =
in the fabrication of the Rotate model based on specification notations =
in both the limitations and engines documents included in the manual =
folder as well as the physical appearance of the pointed cone fairing =
not found on the Pratt & Whitney engine.
>=20
> The MD-11 Fails
> One of the most impressive changes was the aircrafts publicized range =
of 6,725 NM up to 7,000 NM with a 61,000 lb. payload. Unfortunately, the =
reality ended up being that the aircraft could only achieve this with a =
reduced payload of 48,500 pounds. With a full payload, the range maximum =
ended up at 6,493 NM. McDonnell Douglas also touted an improvement in =
fuel burn over that of the DC-10.
>=20
> Both claims proved to be a large part of the MD-11=E2=80=99s limited =
production of 200 units over a short twelve-year span since American =
Airlines quickly voiced their dissatisfaction with their nineteen units, =
claiming issues with the airframe and engines. Singapore Airlines cited =
the inability of the MD-11 to reach its published range as a reason for =
cancelling their order of twenty MD-11=E2=80=99s. The reduced range =
would prevent the aircraft from being useful for their long-haul routes.
>=20
> McDonnell Douglas started a Performance Improvement Program (PIP) with =
GE and Pratt and Whitney in 1990. The PIP lasted until 1995 and resulted =
in the MD-11 being able to meet its published range but it was likely =
too little, too late, as sales of the MD-11 had already been impacted. =
Even with the PIP successfully increasing the range by 8% and the fuel =
burn by 3%, the Md-11 was unable to fly the DFW-Hong Kong route for =
American Airlines. American sold their nineteen MD-11=E2=80=99s to =
Federal Express in 1995. FedEx converted them for freight transport.
>=20
> The attractiveness of the MD-11 waned as a result of these issues and =
changes in ETOPs created a market condition where economics in =
conjunction with the issues of the MD-11 brought about the end of its =
production. When ETOPS-180 allowed twin jets to fly routes as far as 180 =
minutes from the nearest airport evolved from ETOPS-120, manufacturers =
began shifting development to long range twin-jets since these would be =
more cost-efficient than the tri-jet performing the same mission. As =
twin-jets=E2=80=99 flight range increased, the newer jets became more =
attractive to the airlines and the tri-jet fell out of favor.
>=20
> 102 Still Fly
> The last passenger MD-11 was delivered in 1998 and the last freight =
variants were delivered to Lufthansa Cargo in 2001. The very last =
passenger MD-11 made its last flight bearing the KLM livery on 11 =
November 2014 with a low altitude sight-seeing tour of the Netherlands. =
The last European registered MD-11F flew its final flight on 17 October =
2021.
>=20
> FedEx (57 aircraft), UPS (42 aircraft), and Western Global (17 =
aircraft) continue to use the freight variant and converted passenger =
variant for cargo transport. (Information compiled from Wikipedia, =
Lufthansa, Aeroreport, and Simple Flying)

> The Rotate MD-11 has been designed to optimize performance and to =
achieve an optimal CPU/GPU balance. However, it makes intensive use of =
CPU and graphics card, so make sure to adjust X-Plane settings according =
to your hardware and the addons that you use in combination with this =
aircraft. Remember that in X-Plane you can tune parameters like =
=E2=80=9CNumber of World Objects=E2=80=9D, =E2=80=9CReflection Detail=E2=80=

32-bit systems are not supported.
>=20

execution of the software. For that before running the Rotate MD-11 the =
first time, open the Terminal app in your OSX, type this line =
substituting the path to your Rotate MD-11 installation (without the [ =
]) and press =E2=80=9Center=E2=80=9D:

> Once you have obtained the model in a .zip compressed file, you simply =
decompress it and place the Rotate-MD-11 into your X-Plane aircraft =
folder. On your first flight, you will need to activate the aircraft by =
entering your serial number. The process only took seconds when I did =
it.
>=20
> Within the MD-11 folder, after you install it, you will find a folder =
called =E2=80=9Cmanuals=E2=80=9D. In that folder are eighteen separate =
documents: one document for each modeled system. If you are not familiar =
with the MD-11, these manuals will be very important to you. I was =
unable to make my first flight without referring to them in order to =
find items in the cockpit that are mentioned in the tutorial.
>=20
> It would be useful to have references in the tutorial that would point =
the user to the relevant manual. I had to go through several of them =
because I did not know what system some things belonged to so I could =
get an explanation on how to use them. Once I found what I was looking =
for, the explanations were clear and helpful. By the way, here=E2=80=99s =
a helpful tip in case you need it: to be able to hear what you tuned in =
on a radio, you not only have to turn up the volume, but you also have =
to pull up on that volume switch until it lights up.
>=20
> We are now ready to take our first look at the MD-11.
>=20
> The MD-11F Menu
>=20
> Once the MD-11 is installed and you have loaded it into X-Plane, you =
will find a Rotate MD-11 option under the X-Plane plugin menu. Selecting =
that option will present you with a submenu from which you can open the =
aircraft menu. The aircraft menu has four sections that will allow you =
to configure different features of the MD-11.
>=20
> While Rotate=E2=80=99s documentation about the menus states that they =
are pretty much self-explanatory except for the Load Manager, the =E2=80=9C=
use hardware controller tiller=E2=80=9D option offered me a little =
confusion (a bit more than that since I had no idea what a nosewheel =
tiller is =E2=80=93 we don=E2=80=99t have such things in turboprops) =
before getting it sorted. Ivan at Rotate was quite patient with me and =
has indicated a plan to improve the documentation regarding the tiller. =
In the meantime, I can share what I learned with you.
>=20
> The hardware tiller option is effective if you set your axis to =
nosewheel tiller. Check the box and it will work. Deselect it and the =
axis will do nothing. Now, assign yaw to that same axis and the hardware =
tiller checkbox does not apply to you. Yaw will control the rudder and =
the nosewheel tiller simultaneously. The rudder pedal selection acts =
exactly as you would expect it to and is documented in the manual.
>=20
> One important thing to be aware of: selecting ready to start, taxi, or =
depart does not set the cargo and fuel values on the load manager =
screen. (I don=E2=80=99t know how it starts with zero fuel on board.)

> The ground options could also benefit from some explanation since the =
fuel service and load aircraft options are initially not selectable. In =
order to make these options available, you must first enter values in =
the load manager and click the =E2=80=9Capply load configuration to =
aircraft and FMS=E2=80=9D button on that screen. I must admit this took =

nine of the Introduction and Product Information document found in the =
manual folder: =E2=80=9CThe graphic shows the Zero Fuel Weight Center of =
Gravity (ZF-CG) and the Take Off Weight Center of Gravity (TO-CG) for a =
given weight. Y axis represents weight (units are set in the options =
tab) and X axis represents the deviation of CG as a percentage of the =
MAC (Mean Aerodynamic Chord). The lines represent the ZF-CG and TO-CG =
limits. TO-CG and ZF-CG values are shown below the graphic, along with =
the Take Off Weight (TOW), the Zero Fuel Weight (ZFW) and the Landing =
Weight (LW). For the Landing Weight to be calculated, the pilot must =
enter the estimated Trip Fuel. The Payload CG must also be entered =
manually. For further explanation on how to load the aircraft, see the =

>=20
> First the Numbers
> The MD-11 with the GE engines measures about 202 feet in length with a =
wingspan of about 170 feet. It stands about 59 feet in height. The =
maximum payload is 202,733 lbs. according to Wikipedia but the FedEx =
website puts it at 180,000 lbs. Both Wikipedia and FedEx report the =
payload range to be about 4,000 statute miles. Cruising speed is 479 =E2=80=
=93 507 knots with a ceiling of 43,000 feet. The MD-11 fuel capacity is =
38,615 US gallons with a weight of about 260,000 lbs.
>=20
> The modelled MD-11F has three General Electric CF6-80C2D1F engines =
that produce 61,500 lbf maximum thrust. Indicative performance data from =
skybrary.aero states a takeoff distance of 10,170 feet. The MD-11 =
airplane characteristics for airport planning guide includes multiple =
performance charts to determine actual distance incorporating standard =
day variables. You can find that guide here =
<http://www.md-11.org/iac/FC.pdf>.
>=20
> FedEx MD-11F aircraft have door sizes of 102=E2=80=9D x 140=E2=80=9D =
for the main door, either 66=E2=80=9D x 104=E2=80=9D or 66=E2=80=9D x =
70=E2=80=9D for the forward lower deck, and either 66=E2=80=9D x 104=E2=80=
=9D or 66=E2=80=9D x 70=E2=80=9D for the aft lower deck. The main deck =
can carry 26 larger, or 34 smaller, pallets.
>=20
> Walk Around
> (Please note that the following X-Plane settings were used for the =
screenshots in this review and are also the basis for my observations. =
The texture quality is set at maximum, antialiasing at 4x SSAA, =
anisotropic filtering is 4x, and reflection detail is at maximum. Draw =
shadows on scenery is selected.)
>=20
> First Looks.
> The inspiration for this walk around comes from a brilliant video of a =
Lufthansa Cargo MD-11 and its three-member crew on a flight from Germany =
to New York. Check out the following video.
>=20
>=20
> Our walk around will start at the nose of the fuselage where the first =
thing that stands out is the light effects on the model. As would be =
expected, the texture is mostly obscured in bright sun and takes on more =
definition in the shade. The shade also allows us to observe the quality =
of the reflective surface created for this aircraft.
>=20
> We can look up and see through the glass at one angle and see light =
reflect off the glass at another. Note the windshield wipers are in a =
vertical position. This is one of the changes that came out of the PIP =
and tells us that this model should be of an MD-11 produced after 1995. =
Here is an interesting overview of the many external changes =
<https://www.airlinercafe.com/page.php?id=3D392> made to the DC-10 and =
MD-11 during their productions.

close enough, you can read the print on the tires (yes, they are =
Goodyear).

another. You may think that a strange comment, but I have seen several =
instances of detailed areas like this featuring parts that are floating =

the copilot side, we can look up and see the temperature probe and the =
angle of attack gauge. If the wind is blowing and you take the time, you =
can watch the AOA gauge move up and down in response to that wind. The =
cockpit door frame is well defined. Other details abound as we look over =
the surface to make sure the static ports are clear, and the cargo door =
is secure. The very clear and legible signs on the aircraft tell us what =

> Our next stop is a relatively complex area on the model since many =
different larger parts with defined surfaces come together and join =
others. This is deftly accomplished, and I was unable to find any gaps =
between the wing fairing and the fuselage or between the wing and the =
engine pylon or any other join in this area. While we are here, we get =
our first look at the engine nacelle.
>=20
> The nacelle, like the front landing gear, exhibits well defined =
characteristics and sections. The intake surround of the housing has a =
nice, brushed finish that responds accurately to changing lighting =
conditions. At the rear of the nacelle, we find the outer bypass and the =
cone fairing. Here there are a couple of things that caught my =
attention. When in shadow, both parts appear to have a proper =
reflectivity for the material. However, in the direct light, they seem =
to have a much higher metallic gloss than what I observed in several =
online photographs.
>=20
> The coloring of the bypass is correct, but I was not able to find a =
cone fairing that had such a copper appearance. I did see several that =
had a dark brown appearance as opposed to black. Lastly, the very =
detailed pylons are accurately modeled with the pylon fairings that were =
a later addition to the MD-11.

viewing angles, my perception of them is that they have no reflectivity =
and look rather plastic.
>=20

although the brushed look works on the engine intake surrounds.

hinges. These hinges are the same style used on the DC-10 and were the =
last external change made to the MD-11. In December,1997, the outboard =
hinges were replaced with hinges that had fairings protruding beyond the =
flap edge.
>=20

windshield wipers and the flap hinges, we can determine our MD-11 to be =
representative of one produced between 1995 and 1997. The modelling of =
the hinges is accurate and well crafted. All parts fit together nicely, =
and they meet the wing surface perfectly. The animation is excellent and =
favorably compares to what I=E2=80=99ve observed on video. We also have =
a heavy dose of dirt to accentuate the part.

The MD-11 is one of few aircraft that can deploy flaps to fifty degrees. =
This model does just that with aplomb although it is my understanding it =
is something that will never get used. All the moving parts remain in =
the same relationship to each other through the complete animation =
cycle. This is noteworthy to me since I have seen plenty of instances =
involving less animation where this did not happen.
>=20

The wing surface features and texture are very nicely done. Here is one =
spot that can change very dramatically as the ambient light changes so =

aircraft on landing. Apparently, the aircraft can be landed with this =
middle gear retracted in what is called the =E2=80=9Cfemale =

included for the exterior of the aircraft. The wear and tear on an =
aircraft seems to be something of a regular debate in the X-Plane world.
>=20
> Some folks like their aircraft show room new and others like them as =
dirty and beat up as they can be. The argument tends to always devolve =
into how much =E2=80=9Cdamage=E2=80=9D is too much. One developer solved =
this conundrum by creating a feature whereby the amount of dirt and =
scratches can be adjusted to the user=E2=80=99s satisfaction.
>=20
> With that in mind, we look up at the painted area of the FedEx livery =
and find that it is very scratched. Is it too much? That is up to each =
user to decide for themselves. My comment about this is it is very well =
done with the scrapes being much more prominent on raised areas which =
are the areas one would expect to take damage first. They are very =
difficult to notice on white surfaces but if the light is at the correct =
angle, the difference in reflectivity from the surrounding area reveals =
their presence.
>=20
> Moving from scratches to dirt we notice the developers have included =
plenty of it. The dirt has invaded many cracks, crevices, and joins and =
looks like it has been building for years. It also looks like it will be =
a permanent feature of the aircraft. If something is allowed to get this =
dirty, one would expect it to look ground in and it does. The dirt is =
prevalent enough to be visible on both painted and white surfaces.
>=20
> The larger areas of dirt are not as clearly defined given they are =
smudged areas and not deposits. They look brilliant from a distance but =
compromise the appearance of the airplanes texture the closer you get. I =
suspect the deterioration of the texture has something to do with the =
smudges being included in the file that controls the reflectivity and =
definition of the surface. I have never seen this done before since the =
dirt is usually confined to the files used to cover and color the 3D =
surface.
>=20
> The flip side of using this procedure is the dirt areas do not =
maintain the reflective areas of the surrounding surface. This is a much =
more realistic appearance for the distance view of the aircraft when the =
texture wouldn=E2=80=99t be visible anyway.

> A Word on Surface Textures
> While we are on the subject of surface appearance, it seems prudent to =
discuss the appearance of what, in some places, looks like low =
resolution, blurry textures. In order to truly appreciate the work done =
on the various surfaces of the model, it needs to be viewed from many =
different angles and in several different lighting conditions. The files =
used for the surface of the aircraft are 4K resolution files and three =
are used to cover the fuselage.
>=20
> The wings are covered by one 4K file. The files responsible for the =
depiction of surface properties are also 4K resolution files. This =
should produce a pretty detailed exterior for the MD-11 and, in the =
right light, it is pretty dramatic. It also holds up well at a distance. =
It is only when the point of view is close to the aircraft, or the =
aircraft is in very direct and bright lighting, that it begins to =
degrade. This phenomenon is not unique to the MD-11 aircraft. =
Contributing to the perception that the surface texture is not well =
defined is the developer=E2=80=99s situational use of painted surface =
features instead of modeled ones. I have no doubt that this last =
decision is based on a need to balance appearance with performance.

> Moving Parts and details
> Now that we=E2=80=99ve walked about, let=E2=80=99s test a few systems =
for proper operation and see how things look. The first thing we=E2=80=99l=
l take care of is the lights inspection. Once we are inside the cockpit, =
you will see that light switches abound. The switches for the ones =
outside include the beacon, nav, high intensity, taxi, landing, wing, =
runway turnoff, and logo lights.
>=20
> As we walk around the aircraft at dusk, we can see the accuracy of the =
light fixtures in terms of location, size, brilliance, and area =
coverage. The taxi lights and landing lights on the nosewheel pedestal =
are the same fixtures but the brightness intensifies when the switch is =
thrown from taxi to landing. There are also two swing-out landing lights =
mounted to both sides of the fuselage.
>=20
> The wing tip light fixtures are skillfully crafted. The lens =
translucency is spot on, and the fixtures are located perfectly behind =
the lens. When illuminated, both the upper and lower high intensity =
lights are active in an alternating pattern. The remaining fixtures are =
not as detailed in their modelling, most notably when it comes to the =
lenses. The beacons are modelled as solid white fixtures. None of the =
lights penetrate the surrounding solid surfaces when they are turned on.

on the inside lights and see how they appear from this point of view. =
Simultaneously, we=E2=80=99ll get a look at what exterior doors are =
operational. All operational doors are controlled via the airplane menu.
>=20
> Interior lighting as viewed from outside is quite effective at =
creating a realistic effect with one exception. The cargo area does not =
appear to use individual light sources so, when the lights are turned =
on, the interior of the main cargo door illuminates even if it is open. =
The interior lights also do not create any illumination spillage on the =
ground, nor do they illuminate the cargo pods being loaded. That said, =
they still make cargo operations at night feel that much more immersive.
>=20
> The cockpit lights are true lights and what is turned on inside is =
what is visible from the outside including control panel lights. We=E2=80=99=
ll see these more closely once we venture inside.
>=20
> Door animations are true to the style of door in use. Smaller doors =
take less time to open than larger doors. The cockpit doors pop in and =
out of place as they are opening or closing in a very realistic manner. =
If you start the engines and step outside, you can watch the turbine =
fans start rotating and build up speed as the engine comes up. =
Considering these animations along with the flap and gear movements =
we=E2=80=99ve already seen, it is safe to say there is nothing slip-shod =
about Rotate=E2=80=99s use of animation on the exterior features.

> In addition to opening and closing doors, the ground options section =
of the menu is also where you=E2=80=99ll find the controls for the =
interior lights. There are no controls on the model itself. The ground =
options menu also provides for access to ground services without having =
to access the X-Plane ground services control. This menu also allows for =
a specific service selection.
>=20
> Stairs and chocks are self-explanatory. Selecting these options will =
pop those items into place with no animations. After you set up your =
cargo and fuel options on the load manager screen, you can select fuel =
service and load airplane options.
>=20
> The fuel service option only works if the airport has an active =
X-Plane fuel truck. If it has a custom truck or no truck, the menu will =
indicate refueling but nothing happens other than ground service =
informing you that =E2=80=9Cservice is not available=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9C=

>=20

Rotate has found a very nice balance between providing something =
visually aesthetic without costing us a lot of frame rate for an area =
that most people will not spend very much time in. To see how they did =
this, we will make our first stop the lower cargo deck.
>=20
> The lower deck is comprised of a forward and an aft section. The view =
from the exterior through the open doors is exactly what you see if you =
step inside. The walls, ceiling, and floor are all well executed photo =
quality surfaces that require very few resources to draw and are yet =
very convincing. =46rom a distance, it is difficult to tell that the =
space between the wall panels is not modeled construction. Lighting =
appears to be lit textures rather than actual lights since no shadows =
are cast and light paths are not defined.

Immediately noticeable is Rotate=E2=80=99s expectation that the virtual =
pilot isn=E2=80=99t going to make much use of this, so this is another =
area depicted in a way to not use much in the way of frame rate. The =
entry curtain, seats, and cabinets are modelled but everything is =
covered with very low-resolution textures. Interactivity in this area is =
limited to opening the door to the flight deck or watching the doors =
open after selecting that option from the aircraft menu.

> First Impression
> At long last, we finally arrive at Rotate=E2=80=99s main reason for =
developing this aircraft: the multiple panels, controls, and electronics =
that make this aircraft a true =E2=80=9Cpilot=E2=80=99s aircraft=E2=80=9D.=
 Let=E2=80=99s begin with a general look around to see what we=E2=80=99ll =
be focusing on.
>=20
> We are going to begin not from the captain=E2=80=99s chair where you =
find yourself on start-up, but with the viewpoint of walking through the =
cockpit door. When you open the door from the galley and step up, you =
are presented with a panoramic view that can be overwhelming in its =
detail, especially for a bush pilot like yours truly.
>=20
> So, let=E2=80=99s begin with the simple things like turning around and =
checking out the door. That mirror on the door is an active reflection =
of what is in front of the aircraft. Turn to the right and you will find =
the safety inspection checklist stuck to the door frame. This is very =
clear and legible, thereby making it useful.
>=20
> Looking further to the right, as well as overhead, we can see banks of =
circuit breakers. The breakers are not functional, but they are =
incredibly well made. The text is clear and sharp so you can identify =
what each one does. Right below the circuit panels is the jump seat. =
This seat, like the Captain=E2=80=99s and First Officer=E2=80=99s, has =
large, clearly printed instruction and warning signs on it.
>=20
> None of the seats have any interactive or animated features. The seat =
cushions are worth a look only for the success Rotate accomplished in =
rendering a fur texture. The texture is at its best when there is =
indirect light on it that enhances the depth by illuminating highlights =
and deepening shadows.

> Moving on, we can take a look at the other features that add to the =
flight deck ambiance. These are, of course, anything that is not a =
flight control of one sort or another. What Rotate did not put into the =
cargo areas or the galley, they have included in the cockpit in =
abundance. Textures are crisp, thorough, and well defined with the =
details going right down to the screws holding things together.
>=20
> They stand up to the close views necessitated by being in such a small =
space. Shadows and highlights are responsive to lighting conditions, and =
everything is pieced together perfectly. Various places show differing =
amounts of wear and dirt that seems to fit the different levels of =
usage. The windows have some dirt on them, and they are operational by =
clicking on the lever marked with a caution notice.
>=20
> Speaking of the caution notice, the sun visors are functional and, by =
default are at the back of the side window. You can drag them all the =
way around to the front and adjust them to any angle. What is there not =
to like about this cockpit? The only thing missing is the bobble-head =
dashboard statue!

> Flight Controls and Panels
> Rotate identifies the following as modeled areas in the cockpit: The =
forward and aft pedestal, the forward and aft overhead panel, the =
glareshield, and instrument, light, and auxiliary panels for both the =
Captain and First Officer. Then, of course, there are the two flight =
yokes.
>=20
> Taking a seat in the Captain=E2=80=99s chair, the most obvious thing =
is, of course, the flight yoke. Of all the places showing wear, not much =
shows more than these scraped and dirty yokes and the floor and rudder =
pedals behind. The checklist is clear and easy to read. To the left are =
the source input select and light control panels. On the pilot=E2=80=99s =
left side, below the light control panel, is the nosewheel tiller. I =
won=E2=80=99t tell you how embarrassingly long it took this bush pilot =
who never heard of a nosewheel tiller to figure out this black handle is =
what controls it.
>=20
> Immediately ahead of the overhead panel is a standby compass that =
folds down. There is a switch labelled STBY COMP to control the light =
for it at the front of the overhead panel. May you never need this.

> Directly in front is the instrument panel. This panel features six =
display units. Panels 1 and 6 are the primary flight displays (PFD). =
Panels 2 and 5 are the navigation displays (ND). Panel 3 is the engine =
and alert display (EAD), and panel 4 is the system display (SD). Every =
one of these displays show signs of wear and tear, but the displayed =
information is bright, clear, and easy to read. The only drawback to the =
instrument panel, and the FMCs on the pedestal is they do not have a =
pop-up feature.
>=20
> This makes using them during your flight a bit difficult since zooming =
in on the FMC removes many other things from sight. There are several =
situations where you might want the FMC and the EAD in one view. =
Additionally, there are switches on the pedestal that effect what is =
displayed on the EAD and it is difficult to get the switches, FMC, and =
EAD all in the same view and still have the FMC keypad at a usable size.

> The other difficulty I=E2=80=99ve run into in the cockpit is some =
controls are not accessible if your point of view has another in front =
of the one you want to use. As an example, if you are looking at the =
pilot=E2=80=99s FMC from behind the pedestal, it can be difficult to =
access the buttons on the ride side if the slat control lever is in the =
way. That lever has a rather large activation area around the handle and =
attempts to click on the FMC result in the lever receiving the action.

> Another is the bank angle selector. To access this, which is behind =
the heading button, you have to have an angle view and get your mouse =
behind the heading activation area. If you want to move the bank =
indicator in the opposite direction, you have to arrange an angle view =
from the other side of the button.
>=20
> Other than that, every button and switch is clearly marked leaving =
little doubt what they are for. The clarity remains, if not improves, =
once the panels are lit. The lighting in the cockpit is terrific from =
having a dim personal flood light (what I think of as a map light) over =
your head to lighting it up like a city block. Speaking of the map =
light, this is turned on by clicking directly on it. There is one for =
each seat in the cockpit. They can swivel to some degree when you get a =
four-arrow cursor upon placing your mouse over the base of the light.

inspection in the cockpit has been completed, and all switches and =
operational features have been checked. The ground crew will now turn =
over the MD-11 to Angelique van Campen, your Pilot in Command for the =
systems and flight reviews. That said, Angelique will explain more about =
the flight systems during her short and medium long flights.
>=20
> One last note before my departure. If you would like to see an =
excellent video about setting up the cockpit for flight, you can find =
one at this dedicated YouTube video youtu.be/iXuqFbVzDeI. The presenter =
is an instructor at Western Global.
>=20
> Sounds
>=20
> The Rotate MD-11 features several different sounds. The first one you =
are likely to hear occurs when you either connect and activate external =
power or fire up the APU. The cockpit fills with a resounding and deep =
rumble. When you activate the air conditioning, you will hear it as =
another layer of sound. The other cockpit sounds include accurate switch =
clicks and aural alerts. The sounds inside certainly add to the =
immersion of the experience.
>=20
> Outside the aircraft, engine sounds are realistic including the APU. =
Once the main engines are started, the range of sound for the engines =
gradually progresses from idle to full throttle. If you are a pilot that =
enjoys popping outside the aircraft while cruising on autopilot, you =
will not be disappointed by the in flight audio environment as your =
craft cruises above the clouds.
>=20
> Section I =E2=80=93 Preparations | Hardware
>=20
> Angelique will first take you on a short tour related to the connected =
hardware. Of course, she can=E2=80=99t discuss all different types or =
hardware since she may own a lot, but she doesn=E2=80=99t have it all.
>=20
> Thrustmaster TCA Boeing Pack Yoke Edition
> I checked the X-Plane.Org forum for any hardware questions from =
simmers and I checked the included manuals. I came to the conclusion =
that I couldn=E2=80=99t find much information about this and therefore I =
asked myself the question if and which hardware will work with the MD11. =
Since I=E2=80=99m also reviewing the latest Thrustmaster TCA hardware =
namely the TCA Boeing Yoke and throttle quadrant, I decided to test this =
also with the MD-11F and see if it all works and if I can assign every =
switch or button to the MD-11F.
>=20
> I=E2=80=99m in the lucky position =E2=80=93 yes yes, I know =E2=80=93 =
that Thrustmaster offered me to review their TCA Boeing Yoke Pack =
Edition with an additional throttle quadrant. Since I have now two =
throttle quadrants, I can assign the SPEEDBRAKE, throttle engines 1, 2 =
and 3 as well as the FLAP/SLAT. And then one slot is left over. But =
let=E2=80=99s be honest, I could also test the Honeycomb Bravo with the =
MD-11F, which, when I write it down, will do. The only problem right now =
is with both the TCA Boeing throttle quadrant and the Honeycomb Bravo =
that the Auto Pilot additions aren=E2=80=99t functional as well as no =
lights on the Honeycomb Bravo. For the latter I really need a dedicated =
json file, but I=E2=80=99ll first start with the Thrustmaster TCA Boeing =
hardware.
>=20
> First of all before I forget it. Since I use two TCA Boeing quadrants, =
you need to select the ENG switches on the front as follows.
>=20
> On the left-hand TCA Boeing quadrant you set the switch to ENG 1&2 =
while on the other quadrant you set the switch to ENG 3&4. Depending if =
you=E2=80=99re a Mac simmer or Windows simmer; on Mac you need to =
connect each throttle quadrant separately to your Mac or USB hub while =
on Windows you can interconnect one quadrant to the other and the last =
quadrant is then connected to your PC or USB hub, but hold on, what =
about the TCA Boeing Yoke?
>=20
>  =
<https://www.x-plained.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Rotate_MD11_review_7=
40.jpg>
> The advantage of the TCA Boeing yoke is that there are no complicated =
selectors or rotary knobs on it. The yoke is only equipped with the roll =
and pitch channels, lots of buttons, two sliders at the mid front, a HAT =
switch, a mini stick and for trim pitch, roll and yaw switches. All are =
just basic X-Plane assignments. No special lua file or whatsoever is =
needed.
>=20
> Worth to mention; suppose you own only the Thrustmaster TCA Boeing =
yoke, but not the TCA Boeing throttle quadrant, you can always use the =
yoke device with another throttle device. That can be the Honeycomb =
Bravo, but e.g. also the Saitek X52 Pro throttle quadrant or the X56 =
throttle unit.
>=20
> Honeycomb Bravo Throttle Quadrant
> First this; I can start right away with that there=E2=80=99s not yet a =
dedicated Rotate MD-11F json file available =E2=80=93 as per April 10th =
2022 =E2=80=93 that makes it possible for you to assign the Auto Pilot =
switches, rotary knob and increase/decrease knob as well as no =
assignments for all the lights. Perhaps during the writing of this =
review, a dedicated json file pops up at the Aerosoft forum. I=E2=80=99ll =
see, but right now I can tell you that all other assignments for the =
speedbrake, throttles and flap will be working with the Bravo quadrant.
>=20
> And yes, you can use if you want or if you own, the Honeycomb Bravo =
together with the Thrustmaster TCA Boeing yoke, or the Honeycomb Alpha =
Flight Controls with the TCA Boeing throttle quadrant. Any combination =
is possible as I already wrote before. It depends on what flight sim =
hardware you have or what your preferences are and how big your wallet =
is. Or if you have non of these above yokes, then you can also use a =
joystick although that=E2=80=99s less realistic.
>=20
> And when you have no rudder pedal set like me, then a joystick is a =
bit more relaxed since the YAW channel also controls the nose wheel =
steering system. Using a separate knob on a hardware device for the nose =
wheel tiller is of course realistic, as long as the neutral point of the =
knob can be clearly felt else it will be dramatic takeoff run.

>=20

<http://www.simbrief.com/home/?page=3Dhome>. Although you need an =
account to get access which is by the way free to register, it comes =
with a wealth flight planning information. When you decide to go for =
simBrief, then you use this URL =

since it offers all aircraft type with data including of course the =

already using for many years is the offline freeware program =
LittleNavMap. (https://albar965.github.io/littlenavmap.html) I can tell =
you that it can do much more then just flight planning. It does =
basically the same as SkyVector, but offers more flexibility. Perhaps =
most important is that it=E2=80=99s a program that can be downloaded and =
installed on your Windows PC, Mac computer or Linux computer. It offers =
many =E2=80=9Csave as=E2=80=9D options including the fms extension from =

bit familiar with the McDonnell Douglas aircraft, the company had a =
large factory for Douglas and McDonnell Douglas aircraft at Long Beach =

it=E2=80=99s the best way to understand how everything works and what to =

engineer with test run license on the MD-80 Series, the MD-11F does have =
a lot more to offer then the MD-80 although I recognize a lot of systems =
in the way they are build.

> The second flight will be as follows. I think it will be a good idea =
to use the Rotate tutorial as a guide, but creating my own FedEx flight =
plan from, logically, KLGB to KBOS (Boston Logan International Airport) =
with an alternate for KJFK (John F. Kennedy International Airport). For =
this flight I use simBrief, and after I entered the necessary data, =
simBrief came up with the following flight plan, including the SID and =
STAR : KLGB FRITR3 AVRRY LANCY J78 DRK J96 GUP J8 BGD MMB PER SGF J98 =

The intention is to takeoff from runway 30, then a left-hand turn, =
crossing California and at Palm Spring VORTAC PSP I=E2=80=99ve planned a =
holding and depending on the practices I want to do, I finally fly from =
this holding back to KLGB. It=E2=80=99s a trip of almost 240NM, so not =
the longest first test flight, but perhaps long enough. The planned =
route looks like this : KLGB SID WILMA DCT FERMY DCT MIDDS DCT WOKRO DCT =

> Creating the KLGB =E2=80=93 KBOS Flight Plan with simBrief
> This flight plan was made for the second longer US flight from the =
West coast to the Northeast coast. What said, the flight plan was made =
with simBrief and will be as follows : KLGB FRITR3 AVRRY LANCY J78 DRK =
J96 GUP J8 BGD MMB PER SGF J98 FAM J78 PXV RID ROD KLYNE Q29 JHW Q82 =
PONCT JFUND2 KBOS.
>=20
> But now the question, how to save it in simBrief and in which format. =
A format or file extension that can be read by the Rotate MD-11F FMS =
MCDU. First of all, the Rotate MD-11F only uses =E2=80=9Ctxt=E2=80=9D =
file formats and not the known =E2=80=9Cfms=E2=80=9D for default X-Plane =
aircraft and also used by other developers. One thing to keep in mind; =
take care that the AIRAC you use with simBrief or Little Navmap are =
always the same as the one used in X-Plane. Next, in simBrief you can =
save the flight plan as txt by using the Rotate MD-11. The simBrief =
flight plan name is KLGBKBOS.txt as is written at the same line. Keep =
this in mind since you need to enter the exact name =E2=80=93 KLGBKBOS =
=E2=80=93 in the MCDU. But you can of course always change the name to =
something else like LGBBOSFEX or LGBBOSUPS1 and so on.
>=20
> Hold on, you can also as Rotate did with their sample flights, rename =
it to ROTKLGBKBOS.txt. Copy the txt flight plan file now to Rotate sub =
folder /user-data/saved-routes. While you=E2=80=99re here, check out the =
following. There=E2=80=99s also a folder named nav-data. In this folder =
you copy the AIRAC cycle content from GNS430.
>=20
> OK, let me check. Nothing forgotten?
> No, except that I could also, as I mentioned before, enter waypoint by =
waypoint in the left- or right-hand MCDU. Interesting to mention that =
the modeled MD-11F has a master and slave MCDU or actually, the modeled =
FMS (Flight Management System) is as in the real aircraft a dual FMS. =
The third MCDU is not really integrated in the DUAL FMS system. It can =
be used for example for RAD NAV.

> Company Route or Saving Rotate Flight Plan
> It is not possible, as it is with some developers, to create a flight =
plan within the FMS. What do I mean with it and is it a problem? As =
explained before, you either create via simBrief or Little Navmap your =
flight plan, save it with a txt extension and copy and paste it as a =
company route in the MD-11F aircraft sub folder /user-data/saved-routes. =
The other option is and also explained in the tutorial is inserting =
waypoint by waypoint in the MCDU. But the Rotate MD-11F doesn=E2=80=99t =
offer the option to enter only the departure and arrival airports and =
let the MCDU create a flight plan itself. This is another option =
available with other developers. Is that then a missing issue? In my =
humble opinion it isn=E2=80=99t since in the real MD-11F it wasn=E2=80=99t=
 possible either.

Menu, Ground Handling Equipment, MCDU INIT Cost Index, MCDU Adding SID =
and STAR, AviTab and WebFMC will be applicable to both planned test =
flights.
>=20
> Although the first flight from KLGB to Palm Springs and then back to =
KLGB isn=E2=80=99t really a long one, I can divert and do whatever I =
want. I added a holding at Palm Springs and from there it=E2=80=99s a =
bit up to me what I want to do else to practice and master the modeled =
MD-11F.
>=20
> The Rotate Menu
> Paul discussed the Rotate MD11 menu already in detail, so there=E2=80=99=
s no need for me to do that again for my flights, but I will highlight =
the things I need for the two flights I plan to do. And yes, I will need =
the Rotate menu for entering my payload and fuel.
>=20
> Ground Handling Equipment
> The MD-11F offers some ground equipment, but as expected, it=E2=80=99s =
not a full set. There=E2=80=99s a FWD passenger door stair, a hi-loader =
with in total four LD4 containers, a GPU, a fuel truck I believe, but =
that=E2=80=99s it more or less. It isn=E2=80=99t a problem for me at =
all, but when you want ground equipment around the aircraft, then you =
need to seek for a solution. One of the possibilities is to go for the =
JARDesign Ground Handling Deluxe add-on. You can buy this add-on package =
at the dedicated X-Plane.Org webpage =
<http://store.x-plane.org/Ground-Handling-Deluxe_p_415.html>. Via the =

> MCDU INIT Cost Index
> A small note regarding the Cost Index (CI) that needs to be entered on =
page 1 of the INIT MCDU page. In the tutorial page 13 you=E2=80=99ll =
find the following about the CI =E2=80=9CThis variable goes from 0 to =
999 and affects fuel consumption and performance of the aircraft. =
Basically, the higher the number, the speed will be higher and more fuel =
will be consumed. We will enter a CI of 50.=E2=80=9D
>=20
> Although being an old Airbus Industries document, =E2=80=9Cgetting to =
grips with the cost index=E2=80=9D, this article is basically valid for =
all aircraft manufactures and models knowing that it goes back to May =
1998. Yes, I=E2=80=99m aware that the manual was written many years ago, =
but it still gives useful background on the Cost Index. For those who =
are interested, just follow this link =
<http://ansperformance.eu/references/library/airbus-cost-index.pdf>.
>=20
> MCDU Adding SID and STAR
> As it is in the reality too, the flight plan has no SID (Standard =
Instrument Departure) and no STAR (Standard Terminal Arrival Route), so =
I/we still need to enter a SID and STAR. The following screenshots shows =
you both flight plans. One of the requirements for the txt flight plan =
file format for Rotate is the presence of the words SID and STAR =
although these aren=E2=80=99t the actual SID and STAR to take or to =
choose from.
>=20
> What I wrote before, real company routes that are loaded in all FMS =
CDU/MCDUs do never have a SID and STAR. That said, when the pilot loads =
a company route, he/she will need to add a SID and TRANS(ition) if =
applicable. A STAR can be added later during the flight since it depends =
on the environmental airport conditions and therefore which runway is in =
use, but after checking with a DLH (Lufthansa) pilot, it turned out that =
these days a SID and STAR are already entered during the departure =
preparations. Of course, different procedures can exist.

chosen also for SID FRITR3, and again, when I had chosen this SID, no =
TRANS is needed. I go for SID TOPMM4, but need to remove the F-PLN =

DU (Display Units) or the MCDUs have 2D popup windows, at least, not =
with the Rotate MD-11F version we reviewed as per April 2022. Having a =
popup MCDU is very handy since you use it quite often for your ground =
preparations as well as in flight. With this plugin you can quickly =
configure a MCDU or CDU on either another screen or in my case, on an =
iOS or iPad device. Logically, I use my iPad for this due to the larger =
screen. Installation and the configuration is straightforward.

>=20
> According to Ivan =E2=80=9Cthe AFS (Auto Flight System) is modeled =
from scratch following the original, with a few simplifications of =
course. The FMS simulates the two FMCs, but for performance issues only =
one instance is processing. In the original MD-11 both FMCs work in sync =
anyway. We have tried to mimic the original functionality and the look =
and feel, but not all pages are simulated, and of course internals have =
been simplified. Three MCDUs are modeled and can be operated =
independently however, only MCDU number 1 and 2 are actually connected =
to the FMCs. The third is not used for navigation except for STBY RADIO =
functions. In our case the third is mostly for aesthetics, and has no =
real functionality implemented. And finally, Auto Slat Extend in case of =

special books where pilots had to look it up by themselves. Modern =
aircraft like Airbus use Octopus. No no, not that animal, but a software =

all, the Rotate MD-11F comes with a build-in pushback function. It =
depends a bit on what you want. When you decide to stay in the flight =

sense nor that it is important to see how the pushback truck is modeled. =
In this case, the Rotate MD-11F doesn=E2=80=99t include a pushback truck =
object. Is it a pity? No, not to me since there=E2=80=99s the =
BetterPushback plugin in case you want to see something outside.

> The BetterPushback truck plugin decides what truck needs to be =
connected. According to BetterPushback =E2=80=9CWhen a tug is called, =
BetterPushback asks X-Plane what the currently nearest airport is to the =
aircraft (presumably that=E2=80=99s the one we=E2=80=99re located at) =
and determines its four-letter ICAO identifier. It then proceeds to =
select a tug. The exact details of the tug selection algorithm are =
beyond the scope of this short writeup. Once a tug is selected, BP =
selects a livery for the tug.=E2=80=9D
>=20
> Engine Start
> I could have started the engines during pushback which is quite =
common, but I need to keep in mind that I=E2=80=99m alone in the flight =
deck and need to monitor many things, even for the engine start. It may =
be a much more modern engine that the General Electric CF6-50 which was =
fitted on the Boeing 747 Classic or the DC-10 Series, to me it=E2=80=99s =
still an old fashioned CF6-80C2. I knew the CF6-80A1/A3 on the Martinair =
Holland A310-200 and yes, the CF6-80A which slightly older then this =
CF6-80C2, it=E2=80=99s still an old engine. Oh yes, we call it a FADEC =
(Full Authority Digital Engine Control) controlled and monitored engine, =
but this is way older then the modern full digital controlled engines on =
the A330, A340-500 and -600, the A350, 787, 777, 747-8 etc.
>=20
> So I decided to start all three engines the moment the pushback is =
completed. Once the pushback truck has been disconnected, it=E2=80=99s =
time to check the papers and believe me, the start procedure of each =
engine is not that difficult, but you need to check more then with the =
previous mentioned ultra modern engines. That said, start sequence is as =
far as I know for all DC-10 and MD-11 aircraft 3 =E2=80=93 1 =E2=80=93 2 =
whereas number 2 is the tail engine. For starting the engines 3 and 1, =
you need maintenance crew down to monitor the start sequence and act in =
case of abnormalities. Engine 2, no need for maintenance personal since =
you can=E2=80=99t see the actual inlet of the fan. It=E2=80=99s way far =
the the back of the inlet.
>=20
> Ok, let=E2=80=99s start and see what=E2=80=99s happening. I=E2=80=99m =
impressed by the way the Rotate team modeled the almost exact speed =
increases in which the N2, N1, EGT and other OIL parameters respond. =
Although it sounds so logic, it isn=E2=80=99t. In real the engine =
parameters responds on the fuel flow, temperature, pressure, internal =
friction of the components and many other items that will influence the =
responsiveness of the parameters. In the Rotate MD-11F model all these =
parameters and their responsiveness are simulated.

> So yes, I=E2=80=99m happy to see how realistic this is modeled. Only =
small remark for now is that none of the EIS DUs (Electronic Instrument =
System Display Unit) have 2D popups. Ok, for the engine start it would =
be much easier when we had a large popup of the EAD (Engine and Alert =
Display) and SD (System Display). It=E2=80=99s all a bit small from this =
distance to see what=E2=80=99s going on at the DUs, but OK, I can live =
with that.
>=20
> For those who are more familiar with Boeing and Airbus aircraft. For =
these two displays I just mentioned (EAD and SD belonging to the EIS), =
Boeing named it the EICAS (Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System) =
while Airbus calls it ECAM (Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitoring). =
Although starting these engines is not fully automatic like on the =
Airbus A350, it=E2=80=99s still easy to do and what I mentioned before, =
FADEC is taking care for some tasks, but not all.

OK, that=E2=80=99s me =E2=80=93 I need to taxi to taxiway L, then all =
the way down to L2 or L1 holding points. While taxiing, have you noticed =
when you make sharp turns, that one nose wheel lifts from the ground?
>=20
> When you look to the position of the nose landing gear versus the =
fuselage, you=E2=80=99ll see that the strut is positioned with a couple =
of degrees forward. This leads to it, that when you make a sharp turn =
with the nose wheel tiller, one nose wheel lifts from the ground. In =
emergency conditions, I repeat under emergency conditions when no ground =
equipment is available, maintenance staff can replace a nose wheel when =
they have no jack available. Check it out yourself when you make a sharp =
turn with the nose-wheel tiller!

> Next, you need to taxi the MD-11F, but it was already the same with =
the DC-10, at slow taxi speeds else the nose wheels are slipping. It is =
mentioned in the Rotate manuals as well as known by Rotate and discussed =
at the X-Plane.Org forum, that must assign hardware for the toe brakes =
and the nose-wheel tiller. When you use a joystick, then the NWS (Nose =
Wheel Steering) is done via the control wheel ROLL, but quite limited =
unless a knob isa assigned for the nose wheel tiller.
>=20
> That said, I suggest that you assign a slider or whatever you prefer =
to the nose-wheel tiller and tick it in the Rotate window and don=E2=80=99=
t forget to save it. When you don=E2=80=99t use or don=E2=80=99t have a =
joystick, but the Honeycomb Alpha or the Thrustmaster TCA Boeing Yoke, =
then you need to assign a slider to the nose-wheel tiller and tick it in =
the Rotate window as previously explained by Paul. Anyway, taxiing the =
MD-11 is not complicated as long as you keep in mind that the NLG is far =
behind the cockpit and thus making turns while keeping on the centerline =
need some practices.

> Some words about the screenshot. As previously said, we depart from =
runway 30 and use SID TOPMM4, but no transaction. Instead, after SID =
TOPMM4 we fly direct to our first waypoint WILMA, followed by FERMY and =
then MIDDS. These waypoints are marked with a red circle. After MIDDS we =
follow the rest of the flight plan.
> When I reach my designated holding point L2, I set the parking brake =
and check the items on the BEFORE TAKEOFF checklist. One of the items to =
rehearse for myself is the takeoff / departure briefing. One thing not =
to forget is if the VSPDS on the PFD are still magenta. If they have =
turned white, then go to the MCDU TO/APP page, CLR all speeds and the =
moment you clear them, new speeds are calculated. Confirm these new =
speeds by clicking the respective LSKs. When you=E2=80=99ve completed =
this, click on the FCP the NAV button and, although not mentioned in the =
tutorial, you can also select or arm the PROF (ile) pushbutton. You =
actually ARM these modes.
>=20
> Oops, one thing before I start with the takeoff. When aligned with =
runway 30, and all set, you slide the throttle levers to 60 percent =
position TLA or easier to understand 70 percent N1 RPM =E2=80=93 =
remember that N1 is only applicable to General Electric CF6 engines =
while a Pratt and Whitney uses as thrust parameter EPR =E2=80=93 and =
press the AUTO FLIGHT button in the middle of the FCP (Flight Control =
Panel). This is the first time you push it which engages the ATS (Auto =
Throttle System). In flight above 400 feet when NAV mode armed, we click =
the AUTO FLIGHT button again, but this time we engage the AP (Auto =
Pilot). You can also press the AUTO FLIGHT button before you advance the =
throttles.
>=20
> Ok, are you ready to join me?
>=20
> Flight 1 =E2=80=93 Part III | KLGB =E2=80=93 KLGB

> Take-Off
> During each takeoff there=E2=80=99s a lot to do and since I=E2=80=99m =
sitting alone in the cockpit, you and I need to check all the =
indications and after lift off, we need to do all the steps from the =
checklist. Ok, we have the luck that we can engage the Auto Pilot via =
the AutoFlight button on the FCP (flight Control Panel) from 400 feet =
and up, provided we plan to fly in NAV mode. A couple of words about the =
AUTO FLIGHT button on the FCP. According to the Rotate manual page 25 =
=E2=80=9Cwhen ready for takeoff, advance the throttles to approximately =
60 degrees and autothrottles will engage, if selected, and will =
automatically advance to takeoff THRUST.=E2=80=9D
>=20
> In the tutorial you will see that at about a throttle positioned of 60 =
degrees =E2=80=93 how do you know =E2=80=93 or as I found in other =
tutorials at about 70 percent N1 RPM which makes to me a bit more sense, =
you should see that the Auto Throttle System drives mechanically the =
throttles forward. You will also see that the N1 goes up to the =
derated/FLEX N1 belonging by the temperature. It takes a couple of =
seconds before I noticed it, but it works. First when you press the AUTO =
FLIGHT button on the FCP, the ATS OFF and box disappear, then when you =
advance the throttles to roughly 70 percent N1, the FMA (Flight Mode =
Annunciator) on the top of the PFD shows T/O Thrust, throttles are moved =
by ATS forward till they reach their position and at 80 knots, the FMA =
reverts to T/O CLAMP.
>=20
> I re-checked what all I can expect according to the tutorials and =
then, after being aligned at the runway, parking brake OFF and release =
your brakes, then I push the throttles forward, and of the MD-11F goes. =
I select as just described the AUTO FLIGHT button which engages the ATS. =
Just as a side note; some airliners have different procedures where =
pilots select this AUTO FLIGHT button while waiting for the lineup on =
the runway, others do it far before this. Anyway, during the takeoff run =
there=E2=80=99s no aural sound that announces 80 knots, or V1 or VR =
implemented (yet), so you have to check that yourself while also =
monitoring the PFD speed tape.
>=20
> At VR, I pull the yoke by following the FD (Flight Director) PITCH =
bar. I need to keep in mind that I need to watch out that I don=E2=80=99t =
pull to enthusiastic else it can cause a tail strike. With a positive =
climb started, I select the gear UP, and monitor the PFD SPD scale when =
I can select the FLAPS and SLATS in steps in. But more important is the =
400 feet for now. I=E2=80=99m allowed to select the AUTO FLIGHT button =
once more which engages the AP. You can also decide to leave the AUTO =
FLIGHT OIFF, and continue to fly manually, but I felt it very difficult =
to fly this aircraft manually, but Ok, that could be me.

Auto Pilot. As with other X-Plane aircraft, this will give you and me a =
huge relief since, again, we=E2=80=99re sitting all alone in the flight =
deck. While the MD-11F is now engaged in the PROFILE mode =E2=80=93 =
meaning that the FMS is connected to the Auto Flight system =E2=80=93 I =

AFTER TAKEOFF checklist and see which items I need to do else. Depending =
on the guides you use =E2=80=93 I believe I=E2=80=99m using right now =
for this flight 4 different tutorials/checklists and procedures papers =
=E2=80=93 I notice that the MD-11F smoothly climbs out towards my first =
initial set altitude. Although the following depends a bit on the =
airliner, and what you prefer, when passing thru FL100, the exterior =
lights have to be switched OFF and, if applicable, the SEAT BELT signs =
of our load masters staff in the front of the UDC (Upper Deck Cargo) =
compartment.

SEL/HLD (Heading Select and Hold) is always possible, but let me do that =
when we=E2=80=99ve reached our cruizing flight level of FL220 and else =
during our longer US flight. As I just said, the MD-11F approaches its =
first altitude. I=E2=80=99ve got two options; or I select before =
reaching this altitude the new and final cruizing level or I wait till =
the AP has leveled off and then I enter the new altitude. For now I=E2=80=99=
ve decided to enter before reaching the new altitude. I turn the ALT =
knob and dial 22000 and since nothing has changed in the ALT PROF mode, =
the MD-11F continues as if nothing has happen. I need to remind you that =
when you enter a new altitude, don=E2=80=99t, I repeat don=E2=80=99t =
PUSH/PULL the ALT knob. If you accidentally do it, then click the PROF =

deck is made is always worth to mention it again. There are some =
animations like the sliding windows and the green sun visors and of =
course, the cockpit door, but that=E2=80=99s it. As for now, the =
armrests are not operative as well as that the pilot seats can=E2=80=99t =
be operated. The more animations you=E2=80=99ll find, the more polygons =
where needed to simulate this and this means in most cases it will =
impact your FPS (Frames Per Second). So to me it=E2=80=99s OK that the =

MD-11 passenger models transferred to full freighters. In particular =
these modified passenger to freighter models have blinded windows, so, =
yes, it is possible that you see these as is the Rotate model.

check if it=E2=80=99s useful to add a STAR and/or a TRANS (ition) or =

MIDDS which was also one of the waypoints when departing. I leave it =
only with the TRANS, and finally click LSK 6L to insert the changes. The =

I enter at the FCP ALT window 4000 feet BUT don=E2=80=99t do anything =

> Descent, Approach, Final Approach and Landing
> With all the preparations done so far, and entered the 4000 feet in =
the ALT window which can be seen in the last two previous screenshots, =
it=E2=80=99s now waiting till the T/D is reached and then at that =
moment, the MD-11F will start its descent, if it all works fine. And =
yes, it does exactly what I expected. At the T/D the MD-11F starts to =
descent, but not only that, it starts to calculate at each waypoint at =
what altitude it has to be including all constraints if applicable. =
That=E2=80=99s very nice to see how this VNAV (Vertical Navigation by =
the FMS) works.
>=20
> Another thing I didn=E2=80=99t mention yet is, the moment I entered =
the ILS runway 30 in the MCDU for our landing, it also included the =
correct ILS frequency of the runway. You can see on the PFD in the lower =
left-hand corner ILGB which is the identification of the ILS. Further on =
you and I can see that since there=E2=80=99s not yet any ILS signal =
received, the PFD shows in cyan NO LOC and NO GS.

don=E2=80=99t have to do anything. It=E2=80=99s all done by the FMS. So =
actually you don=E2=80=99t have to do much. The correct altitudes for =
each waypoint are calculated as well as the speeds, but we still need to =
do a couple of things and that are extending the SLATS and FLAPS =
according to the indications on the PFD speed scale, lowering the =
landing gear, select AUTOBRAKE, arming the ground spoilers, external =
lights and a couple of more items, BUT that=E2=80=99s all in the descent =

waypoint I need to be at 3000 feet, so before reaching 4000 feet, I dial =
with the ALT knob 3000 feet. This is then also the last thing I need to =
do on the FCP except for the APPROACH/LAND pushbutton. The moment I =
click the button, and the ILS signal is already available, the PFD FMA =
shows on top LOC (Localizer) and G/S (Glide Slope) and LAND ARMED, all =
in white. The moment the G/S is captured, I select the landing gear =
handle DOWN. In the mean time, the Auto Flight system follows the LOC =

screenshot and that are the hydraulic actuators that operate the FLAPS. =
OK, I can imagine that the Rotate 3D modeler didn=E2=80=99t include that =
for the simple reason, hydraulic actuators are made up of polygons and =
more unnecessary polygons means less available FPS. But for me it looks =
a bit weird since I know there should be large hydraulic actuators with =
the hydraulic lines. Anyway, that=E2=80=99s just me!

> The MD-11F slowly follows the G/S path, below I=E2=80=99m passing the =
Walter (stadium ) pyramid, with on my right Disneyland Anaheim and =
before I know, I almost down at runway 30. As you can see in one of the =
previous screenshots, I selected the APPR MAP view =E2=80=93 pretty =
basic to be honest =E2=80=93 with the CDI (Course Deviation Needle) on =
the ND and hopefully it aligns with the ILS signal but that works OK. As =
you can see on the screenshots, initially the LOC and G/S are white =
which means these ILS modes are captured while at around 1400 feet the =
LOC and G/s turn green as well as DUAL LAND.
>=20
> When at 50 feet AGL (Above Ground Level) LOC is replaced by ALIGN, =
while G/S will become FLARE and the ATS RETARDS the throttles. The Auto =
Flight is equipped with ROLL OUT as is also applicable with other modern =
aircraft. At touch down, I select the engine reverse thrust and =
hopefully I stop in time. Welcome back at KLGB, home of the Douglas =

cover yet all what=E2=80=99s possible, but therefore I=E2=80=99ve =
planned a second longer flight. And although it looks perhaps to some of =
you a tutorial, it=E2=80=99s not. I think that=E2=80=99s up to Rotate to =
re-write a more in-depth tutorial, but perhaps some of you do find =
interesting items in this first test flight. I had a couple of issues, =
at least, I thought I had, but with the help of a real Lufthansa pilot =
and Ivan, I managed to experience and write down this test.
>=20

me. Normally I would say that it=E2=80=99s enough right now, but I =
haven=E2=80=99t discuss all the items I want and I think it=E2=80=99s =
also fair towards Rotate since they put a tremendous amount of effort, =
time and energy into this MD-11 project. That said, I need to relax a =
day or two before moving on to my next ferry flight. Again from KLGB, =
but this time to the USA East coast KBOS.

same gate 4, but this time we=E2=80=99re flying to KBOS with a FedEx =
MD-11F. The idea of this second and longer flight is to check a couple =
of other Auto Flight features, and to check once more the modeled =
cockpit as well as the simulated systems, as far as my knowledge goes =
and the manuals allows me to check it out.
>=20

dispatch items are electronically provided. They are not done at the =
dispatch office, but actually, in my flight sim office.
>=20

what I mentioned before, simBrief offers dedicated data for the MD-11F =
being used as reference. No no, I=E2=80=99m not talking about saving the =
flight plan file that is also dedicated in the list for the Rotate =
MD-11F. For the moment I need to rely on the MD-11F data given in =
simBrief since I don =E2=80=98t have the official papers and therefore I =
can=E2=80=99t check it.
>=20

without a step climb. I don=E2=80=99t think there=E2=80=99s a need to =

enough fuel before I=E2=80=99m able to climb any further. We will do =
that later on if there=E2=80=99s a need for.

simBrief you=E2=80=99ll notice that a slightly different flight plan is =
proposed as well as that for that moment (time and date) a SID and STAR =
are added, while in my flight plan I left the SID and STAR out because I =
don=E2=80=99t know yet when I will make the flight, what the weather is, =
which runway at KLGB is in use and what the situation it at KBOS.
>=20
> Then some additional information that I found at the Web, the takeoff. =
I know, I discussed this already during the previous flight, but that =
was more based on the different tutorials. For this second flight I use =
some papers I found at the Web. They are from the MD-11 FCOM and =
identified as Normal Takeoff (ICAO A). Not that I=E2=80=99m totally new =
to this, the advantage of these two pages is that these explain step by =
step what the PF (Pilot Flying) and PNF (Pilot Not Flying) each doing =
during the takeoff run and the initial climb.

which runway is in use, and consequently how to taxi to the runway as =
well as which SID I need to use. Then we need when flying online, the =
weather on the route and of course, at our approach in KBOS and for this =
the TRANS and STAR. Since I=E2=80=99m not flying online, I=E2=80=99m a =
bit free in which or what I do.
>=20
> Lets first concentrate on the SID FRITR3. When we can depart from =
runway 12 then the description for the initial climb will be =E2=80=9CClim=

vectors to cross FRITR at or above 5000 feet, then on track 076 to =

Keep in mind that simBrief and while I write FRITR3, but when you read =
this review after a while, that the number 3 can be number 4 or 5, =

> Oops, is this correct or shouldn=E2=80=99t this section not be =
somewhere in flight during the descent preparations. I thought indeed =
that this was done during flight as I also did during the first test =
flight, but after consulting a real pilot, it turns out that the whole =
flight plan with departure runway SID =E2=80=93 STAR =E2=80=93 arrival =
runway are entered at the departing airport.
>=20
> As was explained to me =E2=80=9Cthe data for the runway plus SID at =
KLGB is more or less straight forward since we=E2=80=99re there so the =
chance that the runway and SID changes is minimum, but for the approach =
and landing at KBOS there=E2=80=99s always a chance that this can change =
for some reason, but for FMS calculations it=E2=80=99s better when all =
data for the flight plan including SID and STAR as well as runways are =
entered. Then it can make the correct calculations.=E2=80=9D
>=20
> Our simBrief dispatch form tells me that I can expect for landing =
runway 33L via STAR JFUND2. Assuming this stays like this, then we can =
select in the MCDU from KBOS the STAR, but let us first have a quick =
look to the following screenshots.

the great features is that you can overlay a STAR, SID, ILS APPROACH =
semi-transparent over the map. Very handy! Ok, from top to bottom =
regarding the screenshots you see first the STAR with with the red =
dotted line our last part of the flight plan namely HI/LOW ENROUTE =
charts Q82 to waypoint PONCT. =46rom PONCT our STAR starts and for =
clarity, I inserted the second screenshot that shows the overview of the =
whole STAR JFUND2.
>=20
> Although the FMS will calculate the speeds and altitudes, the second =
screenshot shows in the left-hand lower corner what tracks and altitudes =
must be followed for an intended approach for =E2=80=9Ca=E2=80=9D =
runway. We have entered runway 33L, but suppose the wind changes =
completely, and we have to use 15R, then the STAR stays the same except =
a different route toward 15R. And if it all changes, and we need to =
select another STAR, then we can do it then. In other words, not unusual =
to change MCDU inputs while enroute.
>=20
> The third screenshot shows you and me the ILS for 33L KBOS =E2=80=93 =
110.70 =E2=80=93 330 with identify ILIP. At waypoint BENNN we have to be =
at 4000 feet, then descending in steps to 3000 feet (COHAS) where the =
LOC should be picked up, and then to 1500 feet NIMOY. At NIMOY the G/S =
signal should also be picked up.

flight, right?
> The reason that I didn=E2=80=99t highlight this subtitle during my =
first test flight and this flight to Boston is because Paul did already =
all the external work. So no need to me to tell you my experience how =
the model is made. Perhaps I highlighted it already in a short sentence =
before, it looks gorgeous, it looks realistic with all the dirt and =
weathering, and the landing gears with wheels are top notch quality. If =
you like weathering is a matter of taste, I agree with you, but it =
reflects something that can be quickly seen in real unless the aircraft =
is just brand new from the factory.
>=20
> Pushback, engine start, taxi, takeoff, initial climb, climb and cruise
> =46rom gate position 4 I need again a pushback however this time in =
the other direction since we takeoff from runway 12, which is the =
opposite direction of our previous flight. The pushback isn=E2=80=99t =
really different as well as the engine start. The taxi is a bit longer =
and this time I faced a bit more problems with the NWS (Nose wheel =
Steering) and the aircraft. I don=E2=80=99t know why, but the NWS angle =
was large enough, but the aircraft didn=E2=80=99t respond as I wanted.
>=20
> Anyway, from the apron I go via taxiway K =E2=80=93 D to D5 and line =
up and wait. In the same way as during the previous flight; I arm before =
NAV and PROF which can be seen as magenta text at the FMA. I can click =
the AUTO FLIGHT button before I line up with runway 12, but I can also =
do it on the runway.
>=20
> Then I advance the throttles to approximately 70 percent, and give it =
some seconds, you will see that the FMA will show T/O THRUST and at 80 =
knots it will change to T/O CLAMP which means the thrust is locked and =
the throttles won=E2=80=99t move anymore during the run thus they are =
clamped. Further on, I=E2=80=99ve selected the runway heading and my =
initial altitude is set to FL120 or 12000 feet (under ISA conditions). =
Just to clarify in case you think =E2=80=9Cisn=E2=80=99t she all the =
procedures and checklist items not forgotten=E2=80=9D? Don=E2=80=99t =
worry, I haven=E2=80=99t forgotten them, but I=E2=80=99ll try to =
concentrate myself on things I wan to show you what I haven=E2=80=99t =
show you on my first flight.
>=20
> Some words about the ATS and the Auto Thrust on for example Airbus =
aircraft. The MD80 Series, the 747 Classics, the DC-10 Series and the =
MD-11 have an Auto Throttle System that drives via an electric motor the =
throttles to any position calculated by the ATS. Even the old airbus =
A310 and A300-600 had this ATS. Modern Airbus aircraft are using the =
Auto Thrust system whereas the throttles or thrust levers are placed as =
fixed positions on the pedestal. The computers calculate in conjunction =
with the FMGS (Flight Management and Guidance System) the required =
thrust but the throttles are no longer driven mechanically to their =
positions.

600 feet, then on heading 121 or assigned by ATC for vectors to cross =
FRITR at or above 5000 feet, then on track 076 to DOTSS. Since this is =
programmed in the FMS, we can only check if the FMS and thus the Auto =
Flight is doing what it supposed to do.
>=20
> And believe me, it does a perfect job. It may sound all familiar, but =
I should not forget to ask for the AFTER TAKEOFF checklist, not to =
forget to retract the landing gear and monitor the PFD with the FLAP and =
SLAT speed indications. While the MD-11F continues with its climb, I =
switch off the TAXI and LANDING lights, after a while I set the BARO to =

> On the above third screenshot I selected on the MCDU the NAV RAD =
keyboard key. I typed in the scratchpad 115.20/176 and clicked LSK 1L as =
is shown in the screenshot. The moment I clicked LSK 1L, it will be =
visible on the ND as can be seen on the second screenshot. When I also =
click on the ECP VOR1, then I also see the magenta line towards the =
selected beacon. Till now nothing happens. And nothing happens means =
that I only tune for a specific VOR or VORTAC beacon along the route =
provided I can receive it, so it=E2=80=99s only for reference, but I can =
do more. When you look closely to the third screenshot you see at LSK 2L =
starting with a star VOR ARM. When you click LSK 2L then you will change =
from NAV mode to VOR mode. No actions are required at the FCP.
>=20
> I think it makes sense when I say to you that the MD-11 is normally =
flown via the FMS or if ATC orders you to follow radar vectors via HDG =
SEL. Flying specific VORs via this method is not really handy, but it is =
still possible, just in case.
>=20
> Ok, one more.
> When you understood the above description and could interpret the =
screenshots, then the following example goes one step further. It is =
namely adding a second VOR. In the following screenshot I tuned for VOR =
1 EED and for VOR 2 BXK. And yes, I clicked on the ECP both VOR1 and =
VOR2 buttons that shows me on the ND VOR1 (cyan) and VOR2 (green) and =
again, in magenta dotted lines that points towards the selected VOR. =
Ideal for crosschecking your PPOS (Present Position). The same as we had =
in the past with the RMI (Radio Magnetic Indicator) we see now on the ND =
MAP mode. The cyan VOR1 single pointer and the green VOR2 double =
pointer!

> Now I want to show you how to change to the HDG mode and if we can =
select HDG HOLD and/or HDG SEL(elect). As I did and how it works in =
real, normally you fly the MD-11 via the FMS, but it is always possible =
and realistic that ATC (Air Traffic Control) directs you to follow this =
or that heading while either climbing out or approaching an airport, =
thus the so known =E2=80=9Cradar vectors=E2=80=9D. Knowing that, I tried =
how easy or not this HDG mode works in the modeled MD-11F. I can tell =
you, very easy although you need to know how and what to do since, when =
you=E2=80=99re also an Airbus simmer, it works slightly different on the =
ND (Navigation display numbers 2 and 5).
>=20
> When flying in NAV mode, the HDG/TRACK window shows =E2=80=93 =E2=80=93 =
=E2=80=93 . To show the current heading you can first look to the ND =
where it shows you the current heading on top of the arc (in MAP mode), =
but for the FCP you need to position the mouse pointer at the middle of =
the HDG knob (arrow up) and click once. The FCP HDG window shows now the =
current heading and on the ND you see the white filled HDG bug. Due to =
this action, the NAV mode is disengaged, and the HDG HOLD mode is =
active. At the PFD FMA, the NAV mode is replaced by HEADING with the =
value as can be see on the FCP HDG window. Although you won=E2=80=99t =
see the word HDG HLD, it is actually the heading hold mode. Verify this =
with the first screenshot below.
>=20
> So then the question pops up how to change to the HDG SEL mode. Ok, =
here we go. Next we turn the heading knob on the FCP. In the example I =
turned the heading knob to 45, but hold on, nothing happens or does it? =
When you check the HDG bug on the ND, you still see the white HDG bug =
and with a dotted line a second HDG bug at 45 degrees position.
>=20
> So I actually set a new heading of 45 degrees, but since we=E2=80=99re =
still in HDG HLD mode, nothing happens. However, when I place my mouse =
pointer again at the middle of HDG knob, but now with the arrow pointing =
downwards, and click, the MD-11F changes from HDG HLD to HDG SEL. This =
means, the MD-11F will turn towards a heading of 45 degrees and the =
white HDG bug changes from the 61 to the 45 position on the ND. Check =
again for yourself at the second and third screenshots.

on the FCP and HEADING on the PFD FMA is replaced by NAV in magenta and =
the LNAV (lateral navigation) mode is engaged again and controlling the =
MD-11F.
>=20
> Another item I want to share with you and myself while the MD-11F is =
in CRUISE and I don=E2=80=99t have to do much, is checking the System =
Display or the 4th display. Actually, the pages you select to show the =
AIR, FUEL, HYD etc. are so called synoptics. A synoptic is a simplified =
representation of the actual system that is shown. Sounds logic, right?
>=20
> Some of the pages you=E2=80=99ve seen already when you followed the =
Rotate tutorial or you started studying the systems or you used another =
tutorial with pictures. Whatever you used for tutorial, you=E2=80=99ve =
seen already the ENG (ine) page with the secondary engine parameters. =
But you=E2=80=99ve also seen the CONFIG page during your flight control =
deflection test and I hope you also noticed the HYD page when you did =
the hydraulic test from the overhead panel.
>=20
> There are a couple more system pages : ELECTRICAL system, AIR and =
FUEL. Actually, the ELECTRICAL SD page shows you the MD-11F AC =
(Alternate Current) and DC (Direct Current) buses. The AIR pages shows =
you the air conditioning of the cockpit, UDC (Upper Deck Cargo) and =
lower deck cargo areas as well as the cabin pressurization system. And =
finally, the FUEL page shows you the whole LO PRESSURE fuel system =
including all the fuel tanks and the FU (Fuel Used) and total fuel.
>=20
> Ok, quickly then the other pages, the HYD system page shows the =
hydraulic tanks including their quantities and fluid temperature, the =
pumps, the ISOL(ation) valves and the output pressure. The CONFIG page =
is a combination of flight controls and their deflections as well as the =
landing gear positions, brake temperatures and tire pressure.

<https://www.x-plained.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Rotate_MD11_review_3=

> Another item I would like to bring to your attention is the PFD =
priority. When you=E2=80=99re familiar with modern avionics systems you =
know this, but when you=E2=80=99re new to these systems then this =
paragraph is for you. Whatever happens, the PFD has always the highest =
priority in a way that when for example DU number 1 fails which is the =
captains PFD, the PFD image is automatically transferred to DU 2.
>=20
> Takes over means that the captains ND is transferred to the 3rd =
display and at the ND the PFD is presented. Even when DU 2 fails, =
there=E2=80=99s still a priority for the PFD which means that the =
captains PFD will then be projected at the third DU from the left. For =
the alert simmer; I simulated the DU failures by switching them OFF with =
the rheostat. These six rheostats can be found below the throttle =
levers.
>=20
>  =
<https://www.x-plained.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Rotate_MD11_review_3=
381.jpeg>
> Although I mentioned it before and knowing that the manuals say it =
too, it=E2=80=99s always worth to highlight the dual or split FMS and =
EIS. As you can see at the following screenshot, I selected on the =
captains and first officers panels different data to be shown on the =
NDs. On the captains ND the MAP is presented while on the first officers =
ND I selected the PLAN mode, but I did more. As you can see, additional =
data for traffic (TRFC) and flight plan data is on the left ND and not =
on the right hand ND. Besides that, the RANGE is also different. So lots =
of possibilities when it comes to what you want to see on the NDs. This =
is just one example of the many to show how the programming is done.

> A general note to saving certain situations.
> Right now, the Rotate MD-11F comes with a couple of situation which =
are pre-programmed for us, but I didn=E2=80=99t see any option to save =
for example a flight situation completely with flight plan, fuel used, =
aircraft status and so on. I sincerely hope this feature as known from =
Toliss aircraft, will be implemented at a later time too.
>=20
> You might know it already, but it won=E2=80=99t hurt when I repeat it =
again. And not only highlighting this, but hopefully you also find a way =
to assign this either to your keyboard or to a switch on your hardware. =
I=E2=80=99m talking about the AP, ATS and Auto Flight system =
disconnections. So here we go:
> =E2=80=93 AP (Auto Pilot) disconnect switches on each control wheel =
horn
> =E2=80=93 ATS (Auto Throttle System) outboard side switch on throttles =
engine 1 and 3
> =E2=80=93 OVRD AFS (override Auto Flight System) on the FCP
> =E2=80=93 GO AROUND activation switch on the front on throttle engine =
2

> I can tell you that this is a long stretch from the West US coast to =
the northeast of Boston. Ok, it=E2=80=99s not a transatlantic flight, =
but sitting in the flight deck for hours doing nothing, that=E2=80=99s =
not easy. On the other hand, while at cruise I added already lots of =
subjects to entertain you and I hope you liked it. One other thing I =
would like to highlight is that I climbed further to FL375 since it was =
suggested by the FMS, as it is in real too. The FMS is clever, very =
clever and knows everything including that for fuel saving it is better =
to climb to the OPT(imum) flight level. You can finds this OPT and MAX =
flight level at the PERF MCDU page. Besides that it shows you the =
OPT/MAXFL, it also shows you the Nautical Miles to go, the expected time =
to arrive and the economical cruise speed in Mach. In the following =
screenshot that=E2=80=99s 0.823.

> As the flight progresses, I check if all goes well, I double check my =
STAR and runway 33L KBOS, and then finally I reach the moment where the =
T/D indicator on the MCDU shows up and of course, the magenta arrow =
pointing downwards. As I explained before in the dispatch approach =
section, at waypoint PONCT the STAR and TRANSITION starts, so somewhere =
there we should see the T/D, calculated by the FMS. And I can tell you, =
that the FMS does a nice job or actually, Rotate did a nice job since =
they had to program this.
>=20
> As you can see on the following screenshots I think it=E2=80=99s a =
good idea to enter the final ILS altitude which is for KBOS 33L level =
off at 1500 feet for waypoint NIMOY, but I could also level off at 3000 =
feet which is the altitude where the localizer signal starts becoming =
available. I decided to enter 1500 feet and the idea is, in case =
you=E2=80=99re new, that the FMS calculates for all the waypoints in =
between the altitude it has to do and yes, this can be found in the STAR =
JFUND 2 ARRIVAL.

 surprise me since the VS is quite high and the higher it is, the =
quicker the IAS (Indicated Air Speed) increases as can be seen on the =
PFD speed tape. It=E2=80=99s easy to know when no more DRAG is needed. =
The magenta message at the ND disappears and the actual aircraft speed =

Smoothly I passes the waypoints AUTUM at 10.000 feet, so according to =
the checklist I need to switch on the external lights, then WINTA, =
HRRIS, SPYSD, BRODI where the MD-11F levels off at 6000 feet. I thought =

quite heavy and it covers 30,000 sq. miles.=E2=80=9D With all that in =
mind, the FPS are pity good. Judge yourself.

> Summary
>=20
> There=E2=80=99s then always the end of a review. Not often a product =
is tested and written by two reviewers. Due to the complexity of the =
modeled Rotate MD-11F, Angelique van Campen asked Paul Beckwith if he =
was interested in helping her with testing and writing. That the review =
will be a long one, that was something she expected already, but again, =
it=E2=80=99s a massive in-depth high quality review. Yes yes, I know, =
only our readers and the developer can tell us if the review is of a =
good and honest quality. Still Angelique thinks that the overall review =
written by Paul and Angelique is one of passion, passion in the same way =
the Rotate team tried to modeled this McDonnell Douglas MD11-F.
>=20
> Since Paul started with the first chapters, I=E2=80=99ll give my =
digital pencil to Paul and let him tell how he experienced this =
commercial McDonnell Douglas model. According to Paul ; what a journey =
this has been. The Rotate MD-11 is not a small aircraft and details =
worthy of mention are many, as we=E2=80=99ve seen. =46rom an external =
perspective, there is little fault to find anywhere on this aircraft. =
People will likely debate the clarity of textures, but I think that is =
something akin to every single piece of anything that is made as an =
add-on to the X-Plane world. Rotate has created sharp and clear textures =
where they are needed and have found healthy compromises to preserve =
frame rates as is a necessity on a model this large and complex. The =
only thing I could not find visual support for is the very shiny =
copper-like cone fairing, especially on an aircraft with so much sign of =
wear elsewhere.
>=20
> The interior of the modeled MD-11F is pretty much without blemish or =
complaint in this reviewer=E2=80=99s opinion. The one place that could =
really benefit from a touch-up is the galley. The low-definition =
textures really do detract from the fine structural work in this small =
area. Once we stepped into the cockpit, the galley is quickly forgotten. =
Perhaps, in a future revision, Rotate might revisit the operation =
circuit breaker question, but that is something only they know. Once =
past those panels, everything else just looks incredible. If appearance =
alone was the basis for purchasing a model, then this would have to be a =
must buy. However, the nuts and bolts of an aircraft model is how it =
operates. Here, once again, I will turn the rest of this section over to =
your pilot-in-command and Angelique can wrap up her comments on the real =
reason we buy add-on aircraft.

had the same feeling as always with reviews, did I not forget anything? =
And again the same answer; myself and Paul did what we could, we tried =
to cover everything, but we also know that this is never possible. You =
always forget to look to this or that or it slipped thru your mind or =
whatever you and I can think of.

> I think I can speak for Paul too that we covered many details, I also =
added some tutorial item in my part, and Paul did it in the same way =
with his sections. I can only say, I was and I still am besides Airbus =
aircraft, a big fan of Douglas aircraft. The Rotate MD-88 is a great =
model, and that=E2=80=99s for sure also applicable to this MD-11F. =
Although I haven=E2=80=99t heard it yet from Rotate, but I guess that =
later an official passenger model will be added. I write on purpose =
=E2=80=9Cofficial=E2=80=9D since unofficially, printers have painted =
already passenger MD-11 liveries.
