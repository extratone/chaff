One of Drafts' most immediately apparent advantages as a *native* iOS/iPadOS/macOS application is readily found in [its integration with Mail](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/actions/steps/system#mail). Though I've personally managed to almost escape my twenties having yet to endure an email-heavy job, I still find the practice of sending topical/sacred information to myself to be the upmost reliable and direct means of retrieving it.  

As I've configured it, within Drafts on any of its 3 platforms, all I need do is press `^M` to have the text of the current Draft sent instantly to an iCloud Mail alias I use for such things.

If I were sending to more folks than just myself on a regular basis, I'd definitely make use of Drafts' [Mail Action Wizard](https://tools.getdrafts.com/wizards/mail) to help simplify and solidify the process of creating a dedicated action, which almost certainly *would not* have the `Send in Background` toggle selected, as demonstrated, for the sake of giving myself a preview of outbound messages to... important folks.  

## Format  

The parameters of [the Mail action step](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/actions/steps/system#mail) can be filled with any combination of items from [the original Drafts template tags array](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/actions/templates/drafts-templates) *or* from the relatively new set of mustache

[body]  
```  

The current version of [my personal Send-to-Self action](https://directory.getdrafts.com/a/1wR) sent [this example result](https://app.sparkmailapp.com/web-share/GFZ2OLZskkVOrDVslliHP_H7lalF_81dS00IvpJv) using the above format.    

If you'd like, you can wrap the [body] tag (or any part of the message, actually) in `%%` and select the `Send as HTML` toggle to have the result rendered as HTML. (See [this example](https://app.sparkmailapp.com/web-share/elWlx8eNRiw1nWICBT5p7eGcTs5XZsFO6-JuM1n1).)
