### Personality Report

One of the most prominent themes in the lives of January 27 people is that of early development, as those born on this day often manifest their talents at an early age. Not infrequently their professions are related to the same theme, and may deal directly or indirectly with young people. January 27 people are usually highly concerned with what is new and keeping young themselves.

One associated problem often encountered by January 27 people is that of premature development—obviously the greatest danger in childhood is that they be exploited or pushed too fast. Not infrequently their projects develop too quickly, their ideas manifest too suddenly, their financial affairs expand too precipitously.

Because those born on this day are psychologically predisposed to speedy decisions, it may be very difficult for them to maintain control over their affairs. In their interpersonal relationships, as well, they may push both friendships and romantic attachments too quickly, thus creating an uncomfortable, albeit exciting situation for the other person involved. Sweeping others off their feet with a kind of tumultuous energy is typical of January 27 people.

Above all, those born on this day must learn patience and discrimination. Not all of their work is of the highest calibre, though they expect it to be and can firmly believe it is. Unless January 27 people pay careful attention to the opinions and reactions of others they may suffer disappointment and rejection. In addition they must learn not only what they can do, but also who they are. Cultivating a realistic outlook toward life is essential for them if they wish to be successful in the world.

For January 27 people, keeping their childlike nature satisfied can be a full time job in itself. They may be accused more than once in their lives of being overenthusiastic, juvenile, childish or even infantile in their emotional attitudes. All maturing experiences—having children themselves, conjugal sex, sharing household duties and responsibilities, holding a job, are both a challenge and opportunity for growth. If those born on this day get stuck in any of the developmental stages of childhood, they run the risk of being an eternal Peter Pan, i.e., never growing up. As charming a role as this may seem, it can wear thin when they find themselves in middle age.

It is not uncommon that January 27 people undergo maturity crises at the ages of twenty-eight, thirty-six or forty-two, when they are faced by stark choices as to whether they wish to fully accept adult responsibilities or not. Such decisions can only be made by the January 27 person him/herself and cannot be forced. Those born on this day must come to realize that retaining youth need not conflict with a maturing and strengthening of character. Working with children and young people, starting new projects and studying the process of learning and creativity can all help to sustain their youthful needs in a healthy fashion.

### Health

Those born on January 27 may be prone to various childhood maladies, some of which can spell lasting difficulties into their adult life. Therefore, parents who have children born on this day must take special care to treat their illnesses swiftly and intelligently. Later in life January 27 people are particularly prone to difficulties with their nervous and circulatory systems, which may in fact be related to each other. Keeping themselves in good shape with a sensible, down-to-earth, varied diet and seeing that they get proper dietary supplements is a great help. In addition, regular physical exercise in the open air is essential, whenever possible.

### Numerology

Those born on the 27th of the month are ruled by the number 9 (2+7=9), and by the planet Mars. The number 9 is powerful in its influence on other numbers (any number added to 9 yields that number (e.g., 5+9=14, 4+1=5) and any number multiplied by 9 yields a 9 (e.g., 9x5=45, 4+5=9). The planet Mars is forceful and aggressive, and Number 9 people thus have the capacity to envelop situations. The combination of Mars with Uranus (ruler of Aquarius) can indicate marked mental abilities but leave January 27 people cool or unemotional most of the time, with periodic, and often childish, outbursts.

### Tarot

The 9th card of the Major Arcana is The Hermit, who is usually depicted walking with a lantern and a stick—he represents meditation, isolation and quietude. The Hermit also signifies crystallized wisdom and ultimate discipline. The Hermit is a taskmaster who motivates by conscience and guides others on their path. The positive indications of this card are stick-to-it-iveness, purpose, profundity and concentration; negative qualities include dogmatism, intolerance, mistrust and discouragement. For January 27 people, the negative characteristics are a warning to those who would hold on to past accomplishments and fail to mature.

## The Week of Genius

- **PRECOCIOUS**
- **UNIQUE**
- **SELF‑TAUGHT**	

- **DISTRACTED**
- **RECKLESS**
- **STRESSED‑OUT**

### Advice

- Clarify a realistic picture of yourself in your mind’s eye.
- A certain amount of undesirable personal interaction is always necessary; try to be a bit more thick-skinned, and if necessary, downright insensitive.
- Cultivate calm, patience and persistence rather than always going your own way.
- Learn to handle frustration and be tough enough to quietly demand the very best for yourself.

Although those born during the Week of Genius may not necessarily be more intelligent than others in the year, they generally learn quickly and exhibit an alert, even high-strung demeanor. Like thoroughbreds, they are hot-blooded types, usually champing at the bit to get on with it. Patience is not one of their virtues, and they show a marked itchiness with those slower sorts who need time to express themselves and make decisions.

They often arouse other people’s amazement, and also jealousy, due to the speed and ease with which they pick things up at the first go. When they are young, this ability may manifest as precocity, but parents and teachers who do not understand them may criticize them as superficial, and for lacking the staying power to see a project through. But although it is true that they are easily bored, they are quite capable of perseverance when they feel it is warranted. Not all of them have the ability to learn so fast, but most value mental skills highly and try to develop them, whether natural or not. They also prize education, but not always the kind found in school: they believe that experience is the best teacher and are often self-taught. The lure of worldly excitement will often entice them away from the classroom, and travel to foreign lands can have a peculiar fascination for them.

In their careers, they want to have things their own way. They rarely do well in jobs where they are told what to do. Self-employment or independent positions suit them better, particularly if their work allows them the freedom to make choices, plan, change direction, follow their instincts and be true to what they believe. Although they can be excellent leaders, whether of families and social groups or in their professional environments, they have no essential need to either rule or dominate. Their greatest need in relation to other people may actually be just the need for attention, since every performer ultimately needs an audience.

It is extremely important for them to give every project they work on their own personal stamp. People who enjoy the individual expression of others are fond of them, but their often destabilizing and self-centered energies can affect group projects adversely. They often seem rebellious, but this is usually because of some attempt to tame or control them. Their impulsiveness can easily bring them into conflict with authority figures, or with those of a more conservative nature.

Once they accept their uniqueness and realize that their social needs and drives are less deep than they think, they will make great strides in their careers. The more enlightened may come to realize they can use their strengths best by pursuing a career that does not necessarily involve social contact. There are many areas of science, music, art, publishing or economics that can fit the bill. Part of the problem they confront in working with others is that they tend to exhaust their talents and energies on those close to them, sometimes in a frustrated effort to fit in and feel that they really belong to a group.

On the negative side, they have a tendency toward self-destructiveness. They are more hurtful to themselves than to others. They can be emotionally unstable, and at times can appear distracted, wired, self-absorbed, and can be easily upset. Their sensitivity to external stimuli may be pronounced in such moods, and they may have an acute need to withdraw to a quiet place, away from the bustle of the world. Easily stressed out, even prone to periodic breakdowns, they must learn to toughen themselves. If they can become less easily aroused, they will deal more effectively with the exigencies of everyday life.

In matters of love, they insist that their mates understand their need for freedom. They will not be tied down to fixed routines and schedules. Friends and lovers with more demanding expectations of them are in for a rude surprise; rarely will they accept restriction. Chafing at constraint, they may just try to find another free spirit to get involved with, a solution that may work in the short term but seldom provides the stability and permanence required for deeper commitment. Some may indeed desire a permanent, faithful, giving and stable partner but may also seek the freedom to carry on all kinds of other relationships, sexual or otherwise, at the same time. By practicing this kind of double standard, these people seek to satisfy both their needs and their desires, but they also show their disregard for others.

Those born during the Week of Genius who choose family life will have to learn to direct their energies efficiently, share responsibilities, budget their time and, above all, conquer their need for attention. Their charismatic side often attracts the wrong kind of people, and this may keep their energy from those whom they love and who really need it, particularly family members. Restricting themselves to a well-chosen circle of close friends, and concentrating on those who have a stabilizing effect on them psychologically and are not needy people, will contribute greatly to their happiness.

### Sun

> The sun determines your ego, identity, and "role" in life. It's the core of who you are, and is the sign you're most likely to already know. 

Your Sun is in **Aquarius**, meaning you are fundamentally unconventional and anti. Comfortable dissenting or straying from the norm, your intellectual talent of abstraction is oriented towards pushing the boundaries of what seems reasonable. You carry a lot on your shoulders and have need to fight for the underdog. It's in your seventh house, meaning you feel the need to distinguish yourself from others through close relationships and long-term partnerships.

### Ascendant

> Your ascendant is the "mask" you present to people. It can be seen in your personal style and how you come off to people when you first meet. Some say it becomes less relevant as you get older. It changes every two hours, so if it doesn't make sense, text your mom to confirm your birth time. 

Your Ascendant is in **Leo**, meaning you come across as bright, good-natured, and magnetic. Your energy makes you seem either like a know-it-all or a live wire—but always the center of attention.

### Moon

> The moon rules your emotions, moods, and feelings. This is likely the sign you most think of yourself as, since it reflects your personality when you're alone or deeply comfortable.

Your Moon is in **Leo**, meaning your emotional self is dramatic, proud, expressive, idealistic, and somewhat self-centered. You need a lot of love, care, and validation from other people. It's in your first house, meaning you find security and safety through your self and self-image—and, because it's your first house, your Moon in Leo is hyper-present in your personality.

### Mercury

> Mercury determines how you communicate, talk, think, and process information. It also indicates how you learn. It is the mind's planet.

Your Mercury is in **Aquarius**, meaning your intellect is insightful, unconventional, and super meta. You have a rich imagination that allows you to think in a way that is abstracted from daily life. You enjoy intellectual banter, though you sometimes push your ideas on others. It's in your seventh house, meaning you are curious about and inclined to analyze your closest relationships and how they affect you.

### Venus

> Venus determines how and what you love. It indicates how you express affection and the qualities you're attracted to.

Your Venus is in **Aquarius**, meaning your romantic side is unconventional, intellectual, and somewhat detached. You can be bubbly and obvious when you like someone, but typically you prefer forms of intimacy less obvious than romance. It's in your seventh house, meaning that for you, love is often expressed in close relationships and long-term partnerships.

### Mars

> Mars is the planet of aggression. It determines how you assert yourself, take action, and the energy that surrounds you—particularly in your sex life, your ambitiousness, and when you're angry.

Your Mars is in **Capricorn**, meaning you assert yourself in a way that is responsible and efficient, and you think things through very intentionally. Highly motivated by ambition, your rationality sometimes seems soulless. It's in your sixth house, meaning you put a lot of energy into routines.

### Uranus

> Uranus stays in each sign for seven years, meaning it rules a generation more than a person. It rules innovation, rebellion, and progress.

Your Uranus is in **Capricorn**, meaning other generations are shocked by your generation's sense of responsibility, seriousness, rationality, and hunger for power. It's in your sixth house, meaning that for you, this manifests in rebelling against dated expectations about routines.

### Neptune

> Neptune stays in each sign for around fourteen years, meaning it rules a generation more than a person. It rules dreams, imagination, and the unconscious. 

Your Neptune is in **Capricorn**, meaning your entire generation finds inspiration through hard work, responsibility, seriousness, and ambition. It's in your sixth house, meaning that for you, this manifests in your ideal—verging on unrealistic and impractical—about routines.

### Pluto

> Pluto stays in each sign for up to thirty years, meaning it rules a generation more than a person. It rules power, intensity, obsession, and control.

Your Pluto is in **Scorpio**, meaning your generation's psyche is comparatively passionate, intense, serious, private, self-obsessed, and perceptive. It's in your fifth house, meaning you personally are transforming outdated definitions of romance, creativity, and pleasure.

## *Bewildering* - Aquarius Sun, Leo Moon
The combination of Aquarius Sun and Leo Moon signs produces the sort of personality that is always there to help people in need; a true humanitarian. Because this trait is so strong in your nature, you’re a bit of an easy mark for con men or other friends and family that would take advantage. You are the one people come to when they have problems and need help. You are proud, independent, and self-reliant, and you don’t like to have your original good opinion of people upset. Because of this, you keep a bad bargain and perhaps stay with a relationship that has gone sour. There are times, thanks to your deeply emotional but expansive and friendly nature, that you need to be hard-headed and practical in dealing with people, particularly in handling people making demands on your time or money.

This combination blends the originality and independence of Aquarius with the emotional warmth and confidence of Leo. Born near a full Moon, you possess the inclination to project your personality into the world or affairs. Sensitive and affectionate, marriage strongly influences your life. Naturally friendly, you have a great capacity for kindness and sympathy, and you love very deeply. Sometimes romantic interests may cloud your judgment and ability for practical action. Just the same, these are both fixed signs, and you are very hard to convince against your will.

You follow your inner feelings and can be positive and determined when you feel you are right. As a leader, you employ a style of warm and affection rather than by using more stern and harsher methods. You have a tendency to be impulsive and jump to conclusions, often making decisions without due forethought.

Principle means a great deal to you and you are strongly influenced by this and by your feelings, affections, and emotions. Success comes most easily, however, when you can keep your emotions under the control of your intellect.

Common to every Aquarius-Leo is confusion about who you are or who you should be. However most finally resolve their difficulties by striking a balance. Instead of denying yourself the rank and authority you long for, you will pursue an ambitious life. Nevertheless, you will always remain thoughtful and sympathetic in your dealings with others. You are a nice individual, a friend to everyone, and you treat others as equals because of your Aquarian nature. However your Leo inner self is solid, dignified, and controlling. In actual fact, you want to be the leader and exercise that authority.

You waver between assertiveness and over- accommodation, authority and compliance, but you want to be loved and valued by everyone, which often holds you back. The two signs of your combination are totally different in essence and character, which gives you a multifaceted personality with many inner battles. Your combination indicates great force, dedication, and purposefulness as well as a lot of intelligence. You are always unsure of whether to rely on your heart or your mind, but decision making may be hard for you.

As with all Aquarians, you see things from a separate, intellectual perspective. However, because your Leo inner nature is very emotional, your heart nearly always has the last word in your life. Many Aquarius-Leos are attracted to the metaphysical and occult and are frequently members of religious cults offering instant salvation. Your extraordinary imagination and self-governing spirit need a constructive outlet for expression. Both of your signs are fixed signs so you must be careful that obstinacy, arrogance, and bigotry do not stand in your path to success. Like all Leos you long for admiration and attention and you have a strong sense of the theatrical, but your sporadic ostentation and kookiness are often funny.

You are prone to behaving on sudden, random hunches because you are impulsive. Unfortunately this often turns out to be catastrophic. Finally, through trial and error, you do well in anything you try, even though you are forgetful and absentminded. You do learn from experience. Dedication is one of your preferred words. Devoted and honest, you are not happy until you have mastered whatever you do. Your youth was probably a disaster or limited in some way. Senseless revolt and inner chaos, especially in your youth, may have been the result.
