Today is the fever fest thing - an event with tickets and games and barbecue and a goddamned bounce house. I have literally never seen such unfortunate disfunction in the communication between a group of actual adults trying to co-accomplish something lmfao. I always have a blast in chaos like this though. it's almost unfair.

something to be said for manifesting something like the good shepherd slaves. we were like all tactical and shit (come to think of it, I'm almost certain we were forbid to talk to each other because there were just too many commands from adults.)
